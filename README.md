Understand how well software engineering agents can use your software library.

## Create library

Language - The programming language

Library - The specific library in said language

## Create taskset

Taskset - Evaluation dataset of one library

Task - Specific coding task within dataset

## Create testset

Testset - Test dataset for one dataset

Test - Individual test case for each task

## Create agent

Model - The AI model

Agent - Model + scaffolding

## Create answerset

Answer - Agent response to each task

Answerset - Set of answers, one for each dataset

## Create benchmark

Result - Result of running tests, one for each task

Resultset - Collection of results, one per dataset

Benchmark - Collection of evaluations, one per library

Evaluation - Model with a full snapshot of the evaluation
